<!--
We send a list of solvables, because we need both the entry and word info. 
Using solvables also helps for Schrodinger puzzles, where the entry.answer column will have 'CLINTON/BOBDOLE' and the entry will have 2 solvables. Since at this point we
know which of the 2 we're interested in (if we searched for BOBDOLE, we don't want CLINTON as a search result), we would lose information were we to send a list of
entries.
